# Personal Project - Expense Tracker

## Description

With the habit of tracking personal expenses for many years, 
I firsthand know the importance of friendly tools for people on forming this beneficial habit. 
However, although many developers have released similar products, 
their solutions are either too complex or lack key features; 
they rarely satisfy my real needs. My expense tracker application aims to fill this gap 
by providing a simple and user-friendly solution. The target users are individuals who want to record 
their daily expenses and incomes in the shortest time and look for a basic analysis of their costs 
for specific periods.

## User stories
- I want to be able to add an expense (or income) to my tracker.

- I want to be able to view a list of my expenses in a specific period.
